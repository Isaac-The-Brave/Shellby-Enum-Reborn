### Pretty decent if you get it to work. Will run a comprehensive scan using a lot of FOSS testing software and ultimately tweaked for efficiency and speed.

A lot of people to credit for their great and fast software, I will do so soon, but I cannot come to this project's aid momentarily as exams have approached. Will ultimately re-optimize this software for future CTF and Bug-Hunting events. 

If you do decide to try and adopt this script to use yourself, BE WEARY OF THE INSTALL SCRIPT! It will upgrade your system. I'm sure many aren't interested in doing that to just run this software. Further more, you'll have to work out some of the installation directories on your own, but the script is commented and should give you the requirements to run it! Good luck.

###Usage
python3 Main.py domain.ex

##Make sure you install all the required packages in:
###Both: requirements.txt and install.sh
